# Venatus Gaming Society - Web Development Task

## Project Overview

This project was created as part of the recruitment process for Venatus, the premier gaming society at NUST, for Round 2 of the Web Development department selection. The task required cloning the Experiments with Google website while demonstrating strong technical skills in front-end development.

## Purpose

This clone was developed to showcase:
- Proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- Ability to recreate complex layouts and interactions
- Understanding of responsive design principles
- Attention to detail in animation implementation
- Problem-solving skills in replicating advanced hover effects

## Technical Implementation

The project faithfully recreates the Experiments with Google website's:
- Card-based grid layout with sophisticated hover effects
- Responsive navigation system
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Cross-device compatibility

While maintaining the original structure and functionality, the content has been adapted to feature gaming-related projects and experiments that would be relevant to Venatus Gaming Society's focus areas.

## Development Approach

This implementation demonstrates:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Custom JavaScript for interactive elements
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Performance optimization techniques
- Clean, maintainable code structure

The project was built entirely from scratch without using any external frameworks or libraries, highlighting core web development skills essential for the Venatus Web Development team.
